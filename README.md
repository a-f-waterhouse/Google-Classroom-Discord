# Connect Google Classroom to Discord!

First sign into Google Apps Script (https://www.google.com/script/start/), and open both code files.

Run Get-Classroom-Ids.gs, which should give you a list of all of the Google Classrooms that you are part of, as well as their corresponding IDs.

You can choose which ID you want to use, and then copy it into the other file Google-Discord.gs, where it asks you to insert an ID. 

The other important part to fill out is where you need to paste in your Discord Webhook link, which can be found through Discord. 

Otherwise, there is the option to create categories and send messages to different channels based on what catengory the resource is part of. You are able to get the IDs of resources by looking at their settings within Google Classroom.
